**Project Summary -**

The COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted society, leading to lockdowns that confined people to their homes and negatively affecting various aspects of life.

Our analysis aimed to understand people's feelings by examining their tweets on Twitter. Twitter is a significant platform for sharing thoughts and opinions on social media.

**APPROACH:** 1.Getting the dataset

2.Importing libraries

3.Importing datasets

4.Finding Missing Data

5.Text Preprocessing

6.Exploratory Data Analysis

7.Feature Engineering & Pre-Preprocessing

8.Model Training

**ALGORITHMS USED:**

1.Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV

2.Decision Tree Classifier(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

3.KNN(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

4.SVM Classifier (Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

5.Multinomial Navies Bayes & Bernoulli Navies Bayes(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

6.Stochastic Gradient Descent(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

**Problem Statement-**

This challenge asks you to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets. The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then.The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns.

**Conclusion 1**
1.We applied eight different models, which included Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV, Decision Tree Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers. These models were evaluated using both Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization techniques."

2.We can deduce that the machine is performing very well in two different models for data analysis. The first model, which uses count vectorization in Stochastic Gradient Descent, is producing the best results with an accuracy of 80.43%. The second-best model is Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV, which uses TF/IDF vectorization and achieves an accuracy of 78.86%. This means that the machine is effectively learning from the data and making accurate predictions.

3.In the future, we'll have the ability to reevaluate the test and compare it with how we feel now to see how our actions have impacted us.
