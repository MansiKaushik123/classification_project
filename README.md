**Project Summary -**

The COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted society, leading to lockdowns that confined people to their homes and negatively affecting various aspects of life.

Our analysis aimed to understand people's feelings by examining their tweets on Twitter. Twitter is a significant platform for sharing thoughts and opinions on social media.

**APPROACH:** 1.Getting the dataset

2.Importing libraries

3.Importing datasets

4.Finding Missing Data

5.Text Preprocessing

6.Exploratory Data Analysis

7.Feature Engineering & Pre-Preprocessing

8.Model Training

**ALGORITHMS USED:**

1.Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV

2.Decision Tree Classifier(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

3.KNN(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

4.SVM Classifier (Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

5.Multinomial Navies Bayes & Bernoulli Navies Bayes(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

6.Stochastic Gradient Descent(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).

**Problem Statement-**

This challenge asks you to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets. The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then.The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns.

**Conclusion 1**
1.We applied 7 models namely, Logistic Regression , Decision Tree Classifier with CV,Navie Bayes ,Multinomial Navies Bayes,Bernoulli Navies Bayes,KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours),Stochastic Gradient Descent,Support Vector Machine

2.We can deduce that the machine is producing the most optimal outcomes for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (using count vectorization) model, achieving an accuracy of 80.43%. This is closely followed by the Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV (employing TF/IDF vectorization) model, which attains an accuracy of 78.86%.

3.In times to come, we will be able to redo the examination and juxtapose it with the current emotional assessment to measure the effects of the actions in practice.
